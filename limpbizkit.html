 <p>Limp Bizkit is an American nu metal band from Jacksonville, Florida.
 They started the band in 1995 and released their first album "Three Dollar Bill, Y'all" in 1997.
The album skyrocketed in popularity with hits like "Stuck", "Faith", "Counterfeit" and more.
In 1999, they released their second album, "Significant Other", with songs that made them very popular at the time.
"Nookie", "Re-Arranged", and their most popular song from that album, "Break Stuff" made the band a lot more popular.
In 2000, they teased their new album with the name "Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water", and everyone thought it was a joke.
When they released the album with the same name, a lot of people criticized the songs for the way they sounded.
Their most popular song from that album was "Rollin (Air Raid Vehicle)".
In 2001, guitarist Wes Borland left the band due to creative differences.
 In 2003, they released the album "Results May Vary", with a temporary guitarist Mike Smith from the band Snot.
Their most popular song from the album was their cover of The Who's "Behind Blue Eyes".
Wes Borland rejoined the band for good in 2011 for the album "Gold Cobra". 
In 2021, they released their album "Still Sucks".
Recently, they released a new song called "Making Love to Morgan Wallen".
They have announced a South American tour for 2025 and might be releasing a new album in the coming year.</p>
