    <p>Linkin Park is an American nu metal/hard rock band from Agoura Hills, California.
    The band first started with rapper Mike Shinoda, guitarist Brad Delson and former drummer Rob Bourdon in their garage.
     They got a bass player, Dave "Phoenix" Farrell and Joe Hahn for turntables. 
    The first ever vocalist was Mark Wakefield, when the band was first called 'Xero'.
    After some demos with Wakefield, he left the band because they weren't going anywhere.
    After he left, the rest of the band allowed people to send demo tapes so they can find another singer with Mike.
    Chester Bennington, who was working at Burger King in Arizona at the time, sent a demo tape to the band and they loved it.
    The band changed their name to 'Hybrid Theory', and started making more songs with Chester.
    After a little while, they changed their name again to 'Lincoln Park', because Chester would drive by it after practices. 
    They had to change the name to get the website domain linkinpark.com. 
    They released their first album, 'Hybrid Theory' on October 24th, 2000.
    It was a hit, and they won a bunch of awards in 2001-2002.
    On July 30th, 2002, they released an album named 'Reanimation', which consisted of remixes of the songs from their first album.
    On March 25th, 2003, they released a new album 'Meteora'. 
    They were able to start playing more concerts than before.
    On May 14th, 2007, they released 'Minutes to Midnight'.
    The song 'What I've Done' was featured in the end credits of the first Transformers movie.
    Another song on the album, 'Given Up', shocked fans with Chester's famous 17 second scream.
    On September 8th, 2010, they released the album 'A Thousand Suns'.
    People were criticizing the band because they weren't keeping the way their songs would sound like on Hybrid Theory and Meteora. 
    On June 20th, 2012, they released 'Living Things', and fans were not happy with this album.
    People said it sounded too much like electronic music, and mad that they didn't keep their metal sounding music.
    On June 17th, 2014, they released the album 'The Hunting Party', which is one of my personal favorite albums.
    They tried to bring back their metal sounding songs, which made some fans happy.
    On May 19th, 2017, they released the album 'One More Light', which would be the last album with Chester Bennington.
    While they were on their One More Light World Tour, Chester committed suicide on July 20th, 2017.
    The band stopped the tour and gave everyone refunds. 
    After Chester's death, drummer Rob Bourdon left the band because of personal reasons, with fans speculating it is because of how much Chester's death affected him.
